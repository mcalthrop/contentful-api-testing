contentful-api-testing
======================

Testing the Javascript API from https://www.contentful.com/ with NodeJS.

## Set up

Clone/fork this project, then:

```
npm install
vi env-setup.bash      # set required environment variables
node api-testing.js    # for the NodeJS testing script
./api-testing.bash     # for the `curl` testing script
```

## Issues

The NodeJS script doesn't work yet. Oops. Working on that now...
